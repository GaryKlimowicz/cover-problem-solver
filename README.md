cover-problem-solver
====================

A simple cover-problem solver based on Knuth's Dancing Links paper.

# Introduction
This is a simple puzzle solver for handling so-called "cover problems", like puzzle piece arrangements and other permutation problems.

It is based on Dr. Donald Knuth's terrific paper, _Dancing Links_. I've lost track of the original reference to the paper.

I used this program to solve some puzzle problems in an International Lisp Conference programming contest (though I did not submit the solution).
